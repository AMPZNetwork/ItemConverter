AMPZ MOD LICENSE (AML)
 
This license is aiming on giving people the ability to use my mod in their modpacks 
while my code is still save and can't be used for low effort projects and other fishy things without asking for permission first.
I want to keep my projects open-sourced but feel like that I need to protect my code because of some people.
 
Summary:
I don't want to over-complicate things with this, so to keep it short,
Don't ship my mod with your modpack, let users or your mod download my mod from the official source (CurseForge) or (Modrinth).
